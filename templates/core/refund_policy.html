            <h5 class="fw-bold">1. Digital Products Policy</h5>
            <p>At ExamForEverybody, our products (Mock Tests, Courses, Study Materials) are <strong>digital and
                    non-tangible irrevocable goods</strong>. Access is granted immediately upon purchase.</p>

            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">2. Refunds</h5>
            <p>We generally do not offer refunds once the product has been accessed. However, we understand exceptional
                circumstances may occur.</p>
            <p><strong>We offer a 7-day refund policy ONLY under the following conditions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The accidental double payment was made for the same course/test.</li>
                <li>The content is technically defective and our support team failed to resolve the issue within 48
                    hours.</li>
                <li>You have NOT accessed or attempted more than 20% of the course content or 1 mock test.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">3. Cancellation</h5>
            <p>You may cancel your account at any time via the "Danger Zone" in your profile. Cancellation does not
                trigger an automatic refund for previously purchased lifetime access courses.</p>
